This is a repository containing my work on Face detection and Face recognition. 

I have used the inbuilt haar classifier and LBPHFaceRecognizer for face detection and face recognition respectively. 

The dataset is a collection of my personal photos and I have attempted classify the photos by recognizing mine, my brother's and my mother's faces. 

The model has a maximum accuracy of 60%.
